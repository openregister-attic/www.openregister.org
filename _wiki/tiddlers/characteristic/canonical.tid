title: 1. Registers are canonical and have a clear reason for their existence
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A register is the only authoritative list of a specific type of thing. It is the source of that information, kept accurate and up-to-date. For example, the company register administered by Companies House should be the single, authoritative place to go to find data directly related to a limited company such as the date it was formed and the date it was dissolved and a link to the registered office.

The purpose of a register should fall within the bounds of a registrar’s [[public task]] — its core role or function.
