title: 8. Registers must have a custodian
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Someone is responsible for each register, as with The Public Guardian, The Chief Land Registrar and The Registrar General.

We'll be refining these characteristics as we continue our work on registers and we'll keep you updated on our findings.
