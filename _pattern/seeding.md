Seeding is the process of finding and compiling the data for a new a register during the [alpha](/patterns/alpha) and [discovery](/patterns/discovery) phases.

1. Choose a [register name](register-name).
2. Find existing lists which may define the register's contents.
3. Report on differences between existing lists.
4. Prepare one or more files of candidate register data.
5. A number of different [maps](/patterns/map) may be generated from the process of seeding a register.
6. Build a demonstration service to present the register data in a way which makes sense to users.
