Seeding is the process of finding and compiling the data for a new a register during the [alpha](/patterns/alpha) and [discovery](/patterns/discovery) phases.

1. Establish the [name the register](naming-registers) to define its scope.
2. Find existing lists which may define the register's contents.
3. Report on differences "show the mess".
4. Prepare one or more tab-separated value files of candidate register data.
5. A number of different [maps](/patterns/map) may be generated from the process of seeding a register.
6. Build a demonstration service to present the register data in a way which makes sense to users.
