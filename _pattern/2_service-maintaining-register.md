This form of register is created using a service, and the custodian performs a quality assurance role. For example, a register of companies could be created from the _register a company_ service. The job of the custodian would be to manage how data gets from that service into the register, to ensure the timeliness of that information becoming part of the register, and to ensure the register is accurate.
