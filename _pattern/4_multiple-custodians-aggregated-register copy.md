![Register Type 1]({{site.baseurl}}/images/register-type-4.svg)

This is where more than one register is created as per type 1, but each register is the same 'shape' and is later aggregated by a service. Example of this might include identical registers for England Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland that are merged in to a UK wide register.
