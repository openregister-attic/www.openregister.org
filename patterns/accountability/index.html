        <h1>Accountability</h1>

<h2>1. Expose the structure of the institutions involved <a href="/register-design-patterns/pattern/1_expose-the-structure.html">#</a></h2>
<p>Registers are infrastructure services. They should make the structure of the system clear.</p>

<p>This involves making clear what institution is currently delivering this register - for example:</p>

<p><em>“Provided by The Cabinet Office on behalf of the Department for Education”</em></p>



<h2>2: Make someone responsible, then name that person <a href="/register-design-patterns/pattern/2_make%20someone%20responsible.html">#</a></h2>
<p>Registers should have a single named individual responsible for the contents. The name of this individual should be published on the register with the contents.</p>



<h2>3: Encourage communication from users <a href="/register-design-patterns/pattern/3_encourage_communication.html">#</a></h2>
<p>Registers should include a way to contact the person responsible for managing them at the
point of access.</p>

<p><em>See also: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles#tenth">Make things open: it makes things better</a></em></p>



<h2>4: Explain the source of authority and trust, don't assert it <a href="/register-design-patterns/pattern/4_explain-the-source-of-authority.html">#</a></h2>
<p>Registers are only as useful as they are canonical.</p>

<p>Explaining why this register may be considered canonical is a key part in establishing this trust amongst consumers of the
contents.</p>

<p>In practical terms, for government registers this will often mean linking to the legislation underpinning the existence of the register.</p>
