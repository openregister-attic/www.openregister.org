## 1: Simple list, single custodian

This is the simplest type of register. A single person maintains a list of things and publishes it to a register for services to use. The [country register](http://country.beta.openregister.org/) is an example of this.

## 2: Service maintaining register

This form of register is created using a service, and the custodian performs a quality assurance role. For example, a register of companies could be created from the _register a company_ service. The job of the custodian would be to manage how data gets from that service into the register, to ensure the timeliness of that information becoming part of the register, and to ensure the register is accurate.

## 3: Multiple custodians, aggregated register

In this case _subsections_ of the register are maintained by different custodians and each subsection is aggregated in to a single register. This is how AddressBase is currently created, with GeoPlace performing the aggregation.

## 4: Multiple custodian & registers, aggregated

This is where more than one register is created as per type 1 above, but each register is the same 'shape' and is later aggregated by a service. Example of this might include identical registers for England Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland that are merged in to a UK wide register.
